        <h3>About me:</h3>
        <p>Nice to meet you! My name is Solomon Vidal. I am majoring in programming withe a minor in web development. While programming is my major, most of my life has been dedicated to art and, I argue, that's what I have a larger portfolio of. I intend to use that to my advantage, however, and create more dynamic and eye-catching websites.</p>

        <br>
        
        <p>Personally, I'm a person who tends to keep to themself. I like reading, listening to music, drawing (of course), journaling, and playing video games. When it comes to hobbies I enjoy, i prefer to keep my preferences open so that I can find something I like in every genre.</p>
