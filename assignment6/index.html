                <p>Imagine that you’re running through familiar roads which have now become unsafe to openly travel on. You’re being hunted down because of something people don’t like about you — because of something you can’t help. All you have is your phone and the clothes on your back, but the internet has been cut off and there’s no way for you to get help; there’s no way of knowing who will help you and who will hurt you. You are trapped and alone; you will likely die. Women and LGBTQIA members, ranging from places like our states to far places in the world, have had to deal with more and more hateful rhetoric. This has led to them being hurt, or worse, killed because of who they are or because they’re protesting. To help in the fight against this form of oppression, I’ve decided to create an app that will provide those in need of safe spaces and monetary assistance the resources they need to survive and recuperate.</p>

                <p>Though there hasn’t been a lot of news on the situation in Iran, it was my inspiration to create this app because of it. This app, “Safe and Silent Sound”, will be, as stated previously, an app offered and provided to women and LGBTQIA members who are in need of safe spaces. In Iran, women are being forced into modesty because of religious policies. Along with that, LGBTQIA members are also being persecuted in the name of religions they may or may not follow. Because of their protests against forced modesty and forced religion, these groups of people have become most vulnerable to hate crimes leading to femicides and the deaths of members of the LGBTQIA community. While Iran may seem like a far away place, our country is not. These situations can still occur in seemingly “first-world” nations like the United States of America. That’s why I’ve made the outreach of my mobile app global; because even if we think we’re safe, it’s better to be cautious.</p>

                <p>The app, “Safe and Silent Sound”, itself is programmed to work globally; it will have all its features even when there’s no wifi or data. The features include a location service for safe spaces inputted into the app by other members, directions and addresses to said safe spaces, an option for funding if the member is unable to provide the means of travel, and a community board to discuss gatherings and protests.</p>

            <section id="four" class="hidden">
                <p>The first feature, “Location Services”, will be a map that you can click on in the app which shows the locations of safe spaces in proximity to where you are. It’ll show the nearest shelter or house with an animated ping. If there’s a doubt about the safety of the places you’ll be heading to, rest assured; people can only provide safe spaces if they’ve been checked and secured through background checks and proof of ID. </p>

            <section id="five" class="hidden">
                <p>Moving on to the second feature, “Directions”, this will be a navigation portion of the app which is tied to the “Location Services” section. What will happen is when you click on your preferred safe space on the map it gives you multiple routes to get to that destination from “safest” to “least safe” and based on the amount of time it takes to travel — aka “quickest route” to “slowest route”. Like most map services, it will provide a route by walking, driving, and other means of transportation.</p>

                <p>The third feature, “Funds”, will be a collective group fund to help other members who have no means of money to either get food, travel to a safe space, or obtain other necessities; It’ll be a form of donation service.</p>

            <section id="seven" class="hidden">
                <p>The fourth feature, “Community”, will be a community board where people can converse and share ideas. It can also be a place where you can communicate with those who are providing you with safe spaces and lodging. With communication being a large part of this app, there will be a translation feature run by those who are either bilingual or multilingual so conversations can be properly translated. This feature is helpful for people who want to communicate with each other but have a language barrier preventing them from doing so.</p>

                <p>To create an app as saturated as this, the programming language that would be implemented is Java because it’s one of the most commonly used languages for mobile apps. Since this app will be free to download, I want to make the language as accessible as possible to programmers — myself included. Another technical aspect to discuss, other than the programming language, would be the look and display of the app. For that, I’d like to do most of the design work as a volunteer so that most of the funding goes towards the actual cause and not to the design and look. Keeping the app simple in design would also make it easier to navigate and would be more practical.</p>

                <p>Women and LGBTQIA members worldwide are persecuted simply for existing and shouldn’t be. While judgment is a major problem, the graver issue is the femicide and hate crimes that it leads to. I want to create an app that helps you find safe spaces and shelters near you in times of need. In a world where it’s still possible to hurt others for one’s beliefs, I believe apps like these should be necessary to provide a means of safety while you’re risking your life fighting for change.</p>
