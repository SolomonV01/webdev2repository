            <p id="Band">Ghost, also known as Ghost B.C., is a Swedish heavy metal band that was formed in 2006. The band's style of music combines elements of heavy metal, hard rock, and doom metal with a theatrical and melodic flair.</p>

            <p id="Ghouls">Ghost's image and live performances are characterized by their elaborate costumes and stage theatrics, which often include pyrotechnics, smoke, and dramatic lighting effects. The band members themselves are known for their anonymity, performing under the guise of "Nameless Ghouls" and fronted by a lead vocalist known as "Papa Emeritus" or "Cardinal Copia," who wears papal attire and a skull mask.</p>

            <p id="Grammy">Ghost's discography includes seven studio albums, the most recent of which is "Impera/Imperium," released in 2021. The band has been recognized with numerous awards, including a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 2016 for their song "Cirice." Despite their anonymity, Ghost has gained a devoted following and is considered one of the most popular and influential bands in modern metal music.

            <p id="Hide">As someone who's been listening to GHOST for a while, I hope that I'm finally able to attend their concert this year on August 15th. Ticketmaster, unfortunately, is a pain and I'm getting taxed twice for tickets because of the fees that I never asked to have so I have to save a bit more money... I think it's fairly ridiculous that I have to pay another half the price of my tickets because of assorted fees and taxes.</p>
